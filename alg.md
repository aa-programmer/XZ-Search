# XZ Ranking System

1. when a user searches for something like "npm install not working" we take every website that in one of the words there and add them a point for each word we add a point
2. (not for now) we will have an ai bot like gemini 1.5 flash for better results
3. if theres any really really 'big' company that has been searched for alot we give them less points but still enough so junk won't come before
4. this is simaler to google but we use hyprlinks like if wikipedia mentions a website you give 10 points and not one but if a small bussness links wikipedia wikipedia will get less
